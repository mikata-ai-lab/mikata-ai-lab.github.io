Let me tell you about one of the most significant moves in AI this year — and why it matters to us here at Mikata AI Lab.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, just announced that **Peter Steinberger** — the Austrian developer behind the viral AI agent **OpenClaw** — has joined OpenAI. This isn't just another acqui-hire. This is a signal about where the entire industry is heading.

## What is OpenClaw?

Previously known as Clawdbot and Moltbot, OpenClaw was launched last month by Steinberger. It's an AI agent designed to:

- **Complete tasks autonomously** without constant human guidance
- **Make decisions and act** on behalf of users
- **Integrate with multiple LLMs**, including Chinese models like DeepSeek
- **Work with messaging apps** through custom configurations

Its popularity exploded, especially in China, where it can be configured to work with local messaging platforms. Even Baidu plans to offer direct access to OpenClaw in its main smartphone app.

## The Strategic Move

OpenAI beat out Anthropic, xAI (Elon Musk's Grok), and Alphabet — all reportedly interested in acquiring the startup.

**OpenClaw will remain open-source under OpenAI's umbrella.**

> "Peter Steinberger joins OpenAI to drive the next generation of personal agents. He's a genius with incredible ideas about the future of intelligent agents interacting with each other to do very useful things for people. We expect this to quickly become a central element of our product offering."
> — **Sam Altman**

Steinberger echoed this vision:

> "It's always been important to me that OpenClaw remains open source and has the freedom to thrive. Ultimately, I felt that OpenAI was the best place to continue driving my vision and expand its reach."
> — **Peter Steinberger**

## "The Future Will Be Extremely Multi-Agent"

That quote from Altman is the key takeaway. This isn't about one powerful AI assistant. It's about **ecosystems of specialized agents** that collaborate, delegate, and coordinate to solve complex problems.

This is *exactly* what we're building at Mikata AI Lab.

## The Concerns

Not everything is rosy. Researchers have raised valid concerns:

- **Transparency**: How will OpenClaw's decision-making processes be audited?
- **Cybersecurity**: The ability for users to modify OpenClaw "practically at will" could open doors to malicious use cases.

These are challenges the entire AI community must address as agents become more autonomous.

## The Numbers Behind the Deal

This acquisition comes at a critical moment:

- **OpenAI** is negotiating ~$100 billion at a valuation between $750-830 billion
- **Anthropic** just closed a $30 billion funding round (valuation: $380 billion)
- The **talent war** is intense: OpenAI acquired Jony Ive's startup for $6 billion; Meta bought 49% of Scale AI for $14 billion

Financial terms were not disclosed, but given the market dynamics, it was likely substantial.

## Why This Matters to Us

At Mikata AI Lab, we've been building **Mikalia Core** — our own autonomous agent system with memory, tools, and self-improvement capabilities. Seeing OpenAI double down on multi-agent architectures validates our direction.

In fact, **this very post was researched and drafted by Mikalia**, our AI agent, via Telegram. She read the original article, explored the web for additional context, and wrote the first draft autonomously. I just polished and published it.

The future isn't about replacing humans. It's about **augmenting human capability through intelligent, collaborative agents**.

And that future is happening right now.
