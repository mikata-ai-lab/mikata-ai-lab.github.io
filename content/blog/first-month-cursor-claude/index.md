## The Skeptic's Journey

A month ago, I was that developer. You know the type — the one who thought AI coding assistants were just fancy autocomplete, that "real developers" wrote every line themselves, that relying on AI would make you a worse programmer.

I was wrong. Not completely wrong, but wrong enough that it matters.

## The Breaking Point

I work full-time at a logistics company. Monday through Saturday, on-site, managing real-world operations. My side projects — SPIO for truck operators, MesaFlow for restaurants, and now Mikalia, my autonomous AI agent — these live in the margins. Late nights. Stolen weekends. Every minute counts.

The traditional approach wasn't scaling. I'd spend hours on boilerplate, on "solved problems," on the kind of code that's important but not innovative. By the time I got to the interesting parts, I was exhausted.

Something had to change.

## Enter Cursor and Claude

I'd heard the hype. Cursor with Claude Sonnet 3.5 was supposed to be "revolutionary." I remained skeptical but desperate enough to try.

The first week was awkward. I didn't know how to talk to it. My prompts were either too vague ("make this better") or too specific (basically pseudocode). The results were hit-or-miss. I almost gave up.

Then something clicked.

## The Vibe Coding Revelation

I stopped trying to program the AI. I started **collaborating** with it.

Instead of:
```
Create a function that processes user input
```

I began writing:
```
I need to handle truck operator check-ins. They're often in a hurry, 
might have spotty connection, and need confirmation fast. The UX should 
feel instant even if the backend is slow. What's the best approach here?
```

The difference was night and day.

Claude didn't just give me code — it gave me **architecture discussions**. It asked questions. It suggested patterns I hadn't considered. It caught edge cases I would have missed until production.

This is what I now call **vibe coding**: you set the direction, the vision, the constraints — and the AI helps you navigate the implementation. You're the conductor, not the musician.

## What Actually Changed

### 1. Speed Without Sacrifice
I'm shipping features 3-4x faster, but not because I'm cutting corners. The AI handles the boilerplate while I focus on business logic and user experience.

### 2. Learning Accelerated
Every interaction is a mini code review. I see patterns I wouldn't have discovered on my own. My Python skills have improved more in this month than in the previous six.

### 3. Context Switching Reduced
With limited time, context switching kills productivity. Cursor keeps context alive. I can pick up where I left off days ago without the usual "wait, what was I doing?" tax.

### 4. Confidence in Unfamiliar Territory
Need to write a Telegram bot? Set up FastAPI? Design a memory system? I can explore confidently because I have an expert pair programmer who never gets tired of my questions.

## What Hasn't Changed

I still:
- Read every line of generated code
- Refactor and optimize
- Make architectural decisions
- Own the vision and direction
- Debug when things break (and they do)

The AI is a force multiplier, not a replacement.

## The Honest Downsides

**It's not perfect:**
- Sometimes it hallucinates APIs that don't exist
- It can be overly verbose
- You need to develop "prompt literacy"
- There's a learning curve to effective collaboration
- It costs money (though Cursor's pricing is reasonable)

**And personally:**
- I worry about skill atrophy in areas I delegate too much
- I'm still figuring out the right balance
- Not everything needs AI — sometimes I still code "raw"

## For the Skeptics

If you're where I was a month ago, here's what I'd say:

**Try it for real.** Not just "I'll use Copilot for autocomplete." Actually try conversational, context-aware development with Cursor and Claude.

**Give it two weeks.** The first week is awkward. The second week is when it clicks.

**Don't abandon fundamentals.** You still need to understand what the code does. AI makes bad programmers worse and good programmers better.

**Embrace the vibe.** Stop trying to be a human compiler. Be the architect, the designer, the one who understands the *why*.

## Looking Forward

I'm building Mikalia — an autonomous AI agent that manages my blog, tracks my goals, reminds me of my health commitments, and helps me stay productive despite my physical limitations (I have cerebellar ataxia).

A month ago, this project would have felt overwhelming. Today, it feels achievable.

Not because AI does it for me, but because AI lets me focus on what matters: the vision, the architecture, the problems worth solving.

That's the real revolution. Not replacement, but **amplification**.

**What about you?** Are you using AI-assisted development? Still skeptical? I'd love to hear your experience.
