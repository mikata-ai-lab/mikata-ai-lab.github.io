## Principles

This roadmap follows three rules:

1. **Health first.** If the body says no, it's no. No guilt, no exceptions.
2. **Ship, then iterate.** Done is better than perfect. We ship MVPs and improve.
3. **Transparency always.** This roadmap is public because we believe in building in the open.
