## What is MesaFlow?

**MesaFlow** is a SaaS platform designed for restaurant management. It handles everything from table management and order tracking to kitchen workflows and basic analytics.

## The Vision

Small and medium restaurants in Mexico often rely on paper tickets, WhatsApp messages, or expensive POS systems that don't fit their needs. MesaFlow aims to provide a **modern, affordable, and easy-to-use** solution built specifically for the Latin American market.

## Planned Features

- Digital table management
- Order tracking (waiter → kitchen → table)
- Basic sales analytics and reporting
- Multi-device support (tablet, phone, desktop)
- Offline-first capability

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- React (Web dashboard)
- React Native (Mobile app for waiters)
- Supabase (Backend, auth, real-time)
- PostgreSQL (Database)
